# Ethereum-Strategies-For-Security-and-Gas-Saving
This repository is the source code for the publication: "Exemplary Ethereum Development Strategies Regarding Security and Gas-Saving"

The test results are viewable in the results folder. The tests on the ERC-standards were inspired by https://www.alchemy.com/blog/erc721-vs-erc721a-batch-minting-nfts and https://www.azuki.com/erc721a and are a continuation of their work.
